# AdaptiveControl50
This is a question-answering dataset in the field of adaptive control, comprising 50 questions along with responses generated by large language model (deepseek v3) and evaluations provided by human experts. The dataset can be used for research on AI applications in domain-specific education.

## The dataset
The dataset file is named ``AdaCtrl50.json`` containing 50 records. Each record contains five fields, namely:
1. Question.
2. Answer. The answers were generated using Deepseek V3 (full-parameter version, September 2025). The following prompt was used for conceptual questions:
"Please answer the following question in the field of adaptive control in a professional, clear, and systematic manner. Your response should be well-structured, logically rigorous, explaining concepts, providing comparative analysis, and including examples. Limit your answer to 700 - 1000 words. The question is: ..."
3. Rate.
  - Rate1: Fully correct
  - Rate2: Mostly correct, but with minor inaccuracies
  - Rate3: Contains errors
4. Category.
 - FDC: Fundamental Concepts
 - CAL: Calculations
 - PRG: Programming
5. Comment.
The comments provided by the instructors for questions rated as 2 or 3.
We invited experienced adaptive control instructors to review and rate the responses generated by AI.
